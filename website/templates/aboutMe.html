        <h3 class="about-section-title">Interests & Goals</h3>
        <p>
          I'm currently learning
          <strong>Python backends with Flask and Django</strong> while actively
          seeking
          <strong
            >internships, collaborations, and full-time opportunities</strong
          >. My interests center around
          <strong>natural language processing</strong>,
          <strong>data-driven systems</strong>, and
          <strong>intelligent application design</strong> that combines software
          engineering with AI technologies. I'm particularly drawn to developing
          solutions where computational intelligence meets practical
          applications.

        <h3 class="about-section-title">Projects & Experience</h3>
        <p>
          Built diverse projects including:
          <strong>Card Stock & Billing System</strong> (Django/MySQL),
          <strong>Text Summarizer</strong> with OCR and transformer models,
          <strong>Restaurant Recommendation Chatbot</strong> using NLP/FFNN, and
          <strong>CashBook</strong> expense tracker (Java/MySQL).
        </p>
        <p>
          Through these projects, I've gained hands-on experience in
          <strong>Backend development</strong>,
          <strong>database design</strong>, and
          <strong>AI model implementation</strong>. Each project has
          strengthened my ability to translate conceptual problems into
          functional software while adhering to best practices in code structure
          and system architecture.
